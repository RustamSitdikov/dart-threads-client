## Getting Started

In the `pubspec.yaml` of your project, add the following dependency:

```
dependencies:
  ...
  threads_client: "^0.0.3"
```

### Run Threads Daemon

You need to run a threads daemon available to the client.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:textileio/go-threads.git
cd go-threads
go run threadsd/main.go -debug
```

### Usage

You can see complete usage examples in the provided test suite:

[https://github.com/textileio/dart-threads-client/blob/master/test/threads_client.dart#L41](https://github.com/textileio/dart-threads-client/blob/master/test/threads_client.dart)

## Development

### Install

Run the daemon, as above. Next, install and run the Dart `threads_client`:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:textileio/dart-threads-client.git
cd dart-threads-client
pub get
```

### Run tests

```sh
dart test/threads_client.dart
```

### Run example

```sh
dart examples/helloworld.dart
```

### Organization

**`examples/helloworld.dart`**

This shows a simple use of the dart client.

**`lib/src/generated/`**

Contains all the protobufs generated by `protoc`. See updating instructions below.

**`lib/src/client.dart`**

This contains the client which wraps the gRPC API. Here, dart-native helper APIs could wrap each client endpoint to give the app a nice way to use the typed requests and responses. 

### Update protobufs

`dart-threads` depends on protobufs built in [go-threads](https://github.com/textileio/go-threads). Until CI is setup, you can manually generate and update the protobufs in this project.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:textileio/go-threads.git
cd api/pb
make clean
make all
ls
```

The result should include,

```sh
api.pb.dart
api.pbenum.dart
api.pbgrpc.dart
api.pbjson.dart
```

Copy those files into, `dart-threads-client/lib/src/generated/`.
